result: 
  - notebook with modified resnet + upsampling + knn 
(and optional pca which does not seem to matter at all).
  - used only first layer of pretrained resnet101
    to get change in image size as (x, y, 3) -> (x/4, y/4, 256),
    bicubic upsampling from torch.nn.Upsample
  - results for knn with 2 clusters look pretty decent,
    not so good for 5 clusters, but still make sense
    (judging from the image only, no other metrics used)
  - see notebook Dimitri/notebooks/attempt_13_03.ipynb

todo:
  - build a proper pipeline 
    (load data,  easily choose between blocks (models)
    for encoder / upsampling / clustering / evaluation metric)
    to test different hypoteses quicky
    (example: change upsampling algorithm: knn / bilinear / transConv,
    run on the whole dataset, compare metrics, choose best)

   - with a good pipeline try other clustering algorithms, change number 
     of used resnet layers, maybe use a bit of supervised learning
